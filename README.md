## What is it and what does it do?

A **real-time race control system** that allows:
- Role-based access to three interfaces:
	* Front Desk: Creates, modifies and deletes Race sessions and drivers.
	* Race Control: Starts race sessions and manages race modes.
	* Lap Line Tracker: Record lap times.
- 4 Info screens:
	* Leader board: Displays the various lap times of racers in a race session.
	* Next Race: Shows the information of the next upcoming race.
	* Race Countdown: Displays time until current race ends.
	* Race Flag: Displays flag of the current race mode.

- Real-time updates using Socket.io.
- Role-based access (Receptionist/Safety/Observer)
- Mobile-friendly interfaces
- Live race timer & race mode control

## How does it work?

### 3. Race Control
* **Safety Officer** starts and stops race sessions.
* Resets session data before each race.
### 4. Lap Line Tracker
* Displays buttons for each driver to record lap times.
* Each driver has an individual lap timer that starts at 0 and resets after each lap.
* Sends lap data to the server when a button is pressed.
### 5. Leaderboard
* Displays race results sorted by fastest lap times.
* Updates in real-time as lap times are recorded.
### 6. Next Race
* Shows the information of the next upcoming race.
### 7. Race Countdown

## How to use the tool yourself?
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

Clone the repository

Open a shell/terminal in your computer.

Use following command:
```bash
git clone https://gitea.kood.tech/egertyakopoom/racetrack.git
```

Next, move to the project folder:
```bash
$ cd racetrack
```

Next, install dependencies:
```bash
$ npm install
```

Next, Construct .env file + Set Up Environment Variables
```bash
# .env
RECEPTIONIST_KEY=8ded6076
OBSERVER_KEY=662e0f6c
SAFETY_KEY=a2d393bc
PORT=3000
```

Now run the server with:
```bash
$ npm start
```
or
```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Once the server start, open your local browser and head to this address:
http://localhost:3000


### (Optional) Expose your local server to external networks using ngrok
If you want the application to be accessible from other devices (for example, to use it on a mobile device):

Sign Up and Download:
Go to [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/), create a free account, and download the appropriate version for your operating system, or;

Install ngrok via Apt with the following command in the terminal:
```bash
	curl -sSL https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc \
	| sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null \
	&& echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" \
	| sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list \
	&& sudo apt update \
	&& sudo apt install ngrok
```

Authenticate ngrok:
Open a terminal, then run:
```bash
ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTHTOKEN
```
Replace YOUR_AUTHTOKEN with the authtoken provided in your ngrok dashboard.

Start the tunnel:
Assuming your application runs on port 3000, execute:
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```
Use the public URL:
ngrok will display a public URL (e.g., https://abcd1234.ngrok.io). Use this URL on any device to access your locally running Racetrack application.
